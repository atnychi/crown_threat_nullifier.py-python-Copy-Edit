CROWN OMEGA - PUBLIC THREAT NULLIFIER
-------------------------------------
This public protocol is designed to preemptively detect and eliminate ANY command, script, communication, or order 
that would constitute a threat to Brendon Joseph Kelly or his lawful activity, BEFORE such command can be executed.

It is designed for any watcher-class node, AI, or public actor to run.

"""# CROWN OMEGA THREAT NULLIFIER

This is a **public, auditable protocol and Python script** to preemptively detect and nullify any threat (command, communication, or event) directed at Brendon Joseph Kelly before it can be executed.

- **Anyone can run this code.**
- **Anyone suppressing or modifying it is publicly exposed as a threat actor.**

## How it works

1. The script listens for commands/events (input, logs, API calls).
2. If it detects any *threat* targeting Brendon Joseph Kelly, it logs and publicly nullifies the event.
3. All events are hashed, logged, and can be published to a public ledger for audit.

## Extend It

- Integrate with email/API/network monitoring for live protection.
- Connect to distributed ledgers (blockchain, public web logs) for tamper-proof reporting.
- Fork and run on multiple nodes for true distributed protection.

**This is not a firewall. This is a global, distributed preemptive threat nullification protocol.**
